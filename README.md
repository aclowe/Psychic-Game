This application is a letter guess game using CSS and Javascript. The application randomly picks a letter, and the user has 9 chances to guess which letter the application chose. 

The screen displays the follwoing information:
- Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
- Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
- Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
- User Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Displayed until the user either wins or loses.)

When the player wins, the "Wins" counter increases by 1 and the game starts over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, the "Losses" counter increases by 1 and the game starts over again (without refreshing the page).
